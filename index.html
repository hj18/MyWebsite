        <h1>Hi, I'm Haia</h1>
        <p>(Still working progress)</p>
        <h2>More about me</h2>

        <p>
            My name is Haia Jihan, I'm a third year computer science student at Heriot-Watt
            University in Edinburgh. I’ve been a gamer since a young age and always dreamed to create games which players can 
            enjoy. <br>
            Video games are my passion. Games such as Dishonored 2 and Prey, made 
            me curious about the thinking process involved in level design and the way programmers 
            are involved in all this. <br>I love gameplay design in games such as Prey give players freedom to 
            reach the destination in so many ways, making players think about their actions, this always amazes me because I keep asking myself how they managed that.
            <br>
            My favourite gaming genres are RPG, games such as Divinity Original Sin 2, Fallout: New Vegas and many more. These games enable me to explore and be someone else.<br> 
            I’m also a massive fan of Metroidvania, especially Blasphemous, Super Metroid and
            Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. In every game the map amazes me, and I try to create 
            my own. 
            <br>
            During my second year I worked as far of a team to creat an online multiplayer game I was responsible for managing the team,
            I also worked on HTML, CSS, some JavaScriple as well and helped with the character design.
            As of now, I'm in my third year learning subjects such as AI which is a big part of video games. In my
            free time I'm working on mini projects to build my portfolio. I also enjoy reading fantasy books and playing the flute.
            I am confident that being part of this internship will help me develop my skills and learn more new and wonderful 
            programming techniques.
